## IEC Chapter 0 & 1
### Preface 
- Primarily applications discussed
- Employment of radiation shielding at higher voltage fusers protecting from radiation
- Plasma space propulsion discussed in the book (fun note)
- For power purposes needs to transition from beam-background neutral reaction to beam-beam fusion.
- 'poissors' (virtual electrodes) sometimes used in place of magnetic insulated grids to form deep potential wells for ion confinement 
### Background
**Root struggle:** 
>"Hot plasma prevents use of a material confinement vessel" - IEC is a method that confines it

**Contextual Information**
> "Some also have the objective of burning “advanced fuels,” defined loosely as any non-D–T fuels [1]. Examples include deuterium–deuterium (D–D), deuterium–helium-3 (D– 3 He), and hyrdrogen–boron-11 (H–B 11 )"

**Alternate methods**
- Whilst focus is IEC - often target it magnetic field confinement of closed torus for fusion
- Fast pulsed approach: Rapid compress plasma to ultrahigh density
- Could burn Hydrogen-boron-11 (H-$B^{11}$) for no neutron output instead producing three alpha particles (aneutronic) but requires ion temperatures of 170keV compared to ~25keV for D-T.
**Earnshaw's Law**
> "An electrostatic field alone cannot confine a plasma."
